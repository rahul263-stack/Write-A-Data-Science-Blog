##################CODE fUNCTIONALITY AND READABILITY ############################
 # done
@Code is readable (uses good coding practices - PEP8)

Code has easy-to-follow logical structure. The code uses comments effectively 
and/or Notebook Markdown cells correctly. The steps of the data science process 
(gather, assess, clean, analyze, model, visualize) are clearly identified with 
comments or Markdown cells, as well. The naming for variables and functions
should be according to PEP8 style guide.

# done 

@Code is functional.
All the project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates successful execution and output of the code.


@Write code that is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary.

Code is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary. All functions include document strings. DRY principles are implemented.




#################DATA ########################
 #done 
@Project follows the CRISP-DM Process while analyzing their data.

Project follows the CRISP-DM process outlined for questions through communication.
This can be done in the README or the notebook.
If a question does not require machine learning, descriptive or 
inferential statistics should be used to create a compelling answer to a particular
question.


@Proper handling of categorical and missing values in the dataset.

Categorical variables are handled appropriately for machine learning models
(if models are created). Missing values are also handled appropriately 
for both descriptive and ML techniques.
 Document why a particular approach was used, and why it was appropriate for a
particular situation.


##################### ANALYSIS , MODELING , VISUALIZATION ####################

@There are 3-5 business questions answered.

###################### Github ########################################
@ must be a public repo 

######################  blog Post ####################################

@ communicate the finding with the stakeholders 

@ there should be a intriguing title and image related to the project 

@ the body of the post paragraph that are broken up  by the appropriate white space
